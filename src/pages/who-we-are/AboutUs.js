                        <h1>A Word From Raymond Gulutu</h1>

                        <p>
                            From my experiences first hand in Ghana, the high level of footballing potential 
                            of players of all ages is without question very high, however, sadly the 
                            frustrations and limitations for those with elite potential /ability face to 
                            further develop a pathway into professional football in the major footballing 
                            countries throughout the world, and in particular the UK and mainland Europe, 
                            which currently is a difficult and for the many unattainable. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It cannot be ignored particularly the difficulties adult players have to overcome to 
                            achieve an opportunity to play professional football in Europe, be it financial, 
                            logistical, visa/work permit authorization. Sadly as result many talented players 
                            will not achieve both their dream and potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am committed to helping create a supported and managed pathway for those 
                            talented footballers to play at the highest level and in best clubs - leagues 
                            there ability can allow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that a key way to combat these difficulties is to create strong 
                            long term relationships with professional clubs that includes early talent 
                            identification, education support, and welfare support at source, that being 
                            in Ghana with a particular focus being those younger players aged from 7-14 
                            whereby they are supported with a view to attending the partnered club academy 
                            at frequent times for both the experience and development monitoring and then 
                            when the player is of an age if he has continued to develop at the required 
                            level, relocate to the place of that club and one hopes embark on the next 
                            phase of the development that being to obtain a scholarship.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is my aim in partnership with The Pathways Sports Foundation Africa (PSFA) 
                            to help build strong pathways for these bridges to be crossed and provide 
                            talented players with a structured and supportive opportunity.
